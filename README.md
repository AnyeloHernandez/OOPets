## Fork the project
If you plan on doing the full exercise and doing a Pull Request then you'll have to fork the project pressing the Fork button above (I know, my instructions are great).

Then you go to the Forked project on your own repos and download it or clone it:

```
git clone LINK_TO_FORKED_REPO
```

Go to the project folder and the run the program:

```
python main.py
```

If you only want to download it and test it 

Download the source code or clone the repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnyeloHernandez/OOPets
```

Go to the project folder and the run the program:

```
python main.py
```

##  How to add your pet
If you are starting on programming or learning how to work on someone else's code, don't worry, here is a step by step on how you can add you own pet and then vizualise it on your program :D

1. Create a new file with the animal name on /pets
2. Use inheritance to set the behavour of an Animal to your pet.
3. Create your own custom methods of the class.
4. To be continued..

## How to make a Pull Request on Github
Now that you have a cute and friendly (or not) pet, you'll wonder how I can push my changes to the main repository. Do not fear, here's how you will do it.

Since you Forked the repo before (I know you did it, I hope), now you have to make a Pull Request:
1. Go to the main repository[linkhere xd]
2. Go to Pull Requests
3. Press on "New pull request" button (is green).
4. Select the main branch from the base repository and your branch from your repo and press Create pull request button.
5. Describe what you changed and Publish.
